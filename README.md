# Forecasting-Energy-Costs
This project focuses on implementing XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, for 
electricity price forecasting in cloud computing environments. The objective is to create an 
accurate and adaptable predictive model that aids decision-making processes in resource 
allocation and cost management. Leveraging historical data, the model incorporates relevant 
features, ensuring precision in predicting short and long-term fluctuations. Emphasizing 
interpretability, the XGBoost framework provides insights into key driving factors. The 
model's adaptability to diverse scenarios and real-time forecasting capabilities enhance its 
practical utility.
